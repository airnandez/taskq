# taskq â€” a lightweight asynchronous task queue
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/airnandez/taskq?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/airnandez/taskq)

## Overview
`taskq` is a intentionally thin layer on top of the standard library for enqueueing and executing tasks asynchronously and concurrently.
Internally, a `taskq` owns a set of worker goroutines which each executes one task at a time.

## How to use
As a user, when you create a new `taskq` object, you can specify the number of worker gouroutines and the size of the waiting area of the queue.

```go
import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/airnandez/taskq"
)

// A 'task' must implement the taskq.Task interface which is defined as
//
//    type Task interface {
//       Execute()
//    }
//
type SimpleTask int

func (t SimpleTask) Execute() {
    fmt.Printf("Hello I'm task %d\n", t)
}

func ExampleSimple() {
    // Create a queue with 2 workers
    q := taskq.New(taskq.Workers(2))

    // Submit 5 tasks for execution.
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        task := SimpleTask(i)
        q.Submit(task)
    }

    // Notify the queue that no more tasks will be submitted
    // and wait for all the already submitted tasks to finish
    q.CloseAndWait()

    // Unordered output:
    // Hello I'm task 0
    // Hello I'm task 1
    // Hello I'm task 2
    // Hello I'm task 3
    // Hello I'm task 4
}
```
